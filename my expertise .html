    <h1>Community Management</h1>

    <p>Working in this space since 2021 had made me familiar with every trend of this market. This space is growing exponentially, many projects are being built but fail to last not due to their product, but because they lack strong community. Communities join, yet projects struggle to sustain. I believe if a project cannot connect with its community and earn their trust, it will eventually collapse whether through token value or market adoption. Don't worry, I'm here to help.</p>

    <h1>Developer</h1>

    <p>I love to experiment with different coding languages and technologies. There are plenty of professional programmers in the market, so I am not here as a full-time developer. It's Web3, not Web2; here, builders develop products and projects that need explanation on how they work and why to use them in technical terms. In Web3, users and investors ask questions related to the product and its mechanism. I am here to fill the gap.</p>
