    <h1>Community Management</h1>

    <p>Working in this space since 2021 had made me familiar with every trend of this market. This space is growing exponentially, many projects are being built but fail to last not due to their product, but because they lack strong community. Communities join, yet projects struggle to sustain. I believe if a project cannot connect with its community and earn their trust, it will eventually collapse whether through token value or market adoption. Don't worry, I'm here to help.</p>

    <h1>Developer</h1>

    <p>I love to experiment with different coding languages and technologies. There are plenty of professional programmers in the market, so I am not here as a full-time developer. It's Web:3, not Web:2 here builder develop product and project need to explain how your product work and why to use your product in technical term. Its not like you develop any social media app and peope will use that without asking any question. In web3 user and investor will ask question related to product, its working mechanism.I am here to fullfill the gap. I know how programming work and how to build on blockchain.</p>
