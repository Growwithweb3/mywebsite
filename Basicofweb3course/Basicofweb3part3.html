  <p> Now let’s discuss how you can position yourself in web3 but remember whatever the field is, you need to have knowledge of other field. Concentrating on only one field may not work here. Yes, it’s okay to have an edge, but if you focus on only one thing, you may miss something big on the table that you could earn from if you have a basic idea about it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="paratwo">
  <H2> Developer </H2>
   <p>   If you are interested in programming field then you can go for block chain development where your role is smart contract building and auditing, node running, build dapps on block-chain, web dev for block-chain dapps. </p>

  <h2> Investor </h2>
   <P> If you are from stock market or forex market and want to trade crypto you can explore crypto trading, investing, ICO, pre-market trading, TGE day trading.</P>

  <h2> Crypto twitter </h2>

  <h2> project testing </h2>
    <p>  If you are unemployed or you don’t know anything about Web3, you can start with this, where you test different projects and later earn some tokens from those projects, which you can sell in the market. Some projects give good rewards for testing, but around 95% will not give you anything.</p>

  <h2 id="CEX"> Crypto Exchange </h2>
  <div class="paraonep3">
  Crypto exchange are like broker of stock market where we can trade crypto currency. We can do investment, future and option trading, ICOs via crypto exchange. Think this like your trading account.
  There are two types of crypto exchange: 
  <ul>
  <li> CEX: Centralize exchange</li>
  <li> DEX: Decentralize exchange </li>
  </ul>
  The main difference is CEX can fuck your fund – you need to deposit your fund in CEX to trade but in DEX you don’t need to deposit your fund as you can trade with your wallet. Both exchange working mechanism is different which we will discuss in advance series.
  Download Binance, bybit for now later we will download more CEX depends on our need.

  <p class="CEX"> CEX guide </p>

    <p> <strong>Send crypto</strong> If you want to send crypto via CEX then simply follow these step:</p>
    <ul class="step">
    <li> click on send and select withdrawal method. There are two ways sending crypto
      . via pay id
      . On-chain withdrawal </li>

    <li> <strong> Pay id method :</strong> This is same like bank to bank transfer where you send can crypto from one same CEX to another CEX. You can only use this method if you want transfer fund between binance to binance or mexc to mexc. You cannot use this method if you want to transfer in different CEX which. 
    <p>click on send - add pay id or gmail address -add amount - send </p></li> 
    <li>  <strong>On-chain method :</strong> This is real method of transfering fund in web3. One mistake and you will lose your fund forever.
      <p>Click on send - Select wallet address - Select blockchain -  Add amount - Check gas fee and send </p></li>
    <li> Check gas fee and click on send </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p> <strong>Receive crypto</strong> If you want to receive fund from others then follow these step:</p>
    <ul class="step"> 
    <li> Same like sending crypto you can receive crypto either in your pay id or in your address. click on (receive/ deposit/ add fund)</li>
    <li> For pay id go in your profile and copy the code - its often called UID also. Copy it and send it sender. </li>
    <li> For on-chain deposit select the blockchain where you want to receive fund and then copy the address. Remember to ask your sender from where he will send fund. If he is sending from CEX then no worry but if he sending from crypto wallet then ask from which chain he will send fund. Suppose he is sending USDT from phantom wallet (sol chain) and you give him your USDT deposit address but in eth chain then your fund will lost. you need to give your USDT coin and solana blockchain adress </li>
    <li>Some adress like solana chain deposit adress are case sensative so take care of that also. </li>
    </ul> 

    <div class="parafour">
    <p class="DEX"> DEX guide </p>

    <p><strong>DEX</strong>  
  (Decentralized Exchange) is a platform where you trade crypto directly from your wallet without using any centralized company. You stay in control of your funds at all times.</p>

   <p><strong>Before using DEX</strong> make sure you have:</p>
   <ul class="step">
   <li>A crypto wallet (Metamask, Phantom, Trust Wallet, etc.)</li>
   <li>Some native token for gas fee (ETH, SOL, BNB, etc.)</li>
   <li>The correct blockchain selected in your wallet</li>
   </ul>

   <div class="parentap3">
   <p><strong>Swap crypto</strong> If you want to swap tokens on DEX then follow these steps:</p>
   <ul class="step">
   <li>Open a DEX website (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Jupiter, etc.)</li>
   <li>Click on <strong>Connect Wallet</strong> and approve the connection</li>
   <li>Select the token you want to swap and the token you want to receive</li>
   <li>Enter the amount and check price impact & gas fee</li>
   <li>Click <strong>Swap</strong> and confirm the transaction in your wallet</li>
   </ul>

   <img src="/Image/DEX.png" alt="dex" class="imgcp3">
   </div>

    <p><strong>Important DEX safety tips:</strong></p>
   <ul class="step">
   <li>Always check token contract address before swapping</li>
   <li>Never approve unlimited spending for unknown tokens</li>
   <li>Fake tokens and scam sites are common in DEX</li>
   <li>Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed</li>
   </ul>

   <p> <strong>here are some dex that you can try </strong></p>
   <ul class="step">
   <li> pankcake swap for bnb chain : <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/swap"> link</a> </li>
   <li> uniswap for EVM chain : <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/"> Link</a> </li>

  <h2 id="cryptowallet"> Crypto wallet </h2>
  A crypto wallet is a place where we get access of our fund, used to receive and transfer crypto via block chain. Crypto is store in block chain and to used that crypto we use crypto wallet. It’s almost same like internet wallet -PayPal  but on blockchain.                   
  </div>

  <div class="paratwo">
  Type of wallet:
  <ul>
  <li>Hardware wallet / cold wallet EG : ledger </li>                                                                                                 
  <li>Software wallet / hot wallet EG: Metamax, kepler, phantom, petra, okx </li>
  </ul>

  <p> The main difference between these two wallets are,
  Cold wallet are hardware wallet, not connected with internet all the time, and you need to buy (cost vary from wallet type).</p>

  <p>Hot wallet are software wallet, connected with internet because it on your device and free to download. The security of hot wallet is based on the device where you download that wallet. If you use many third party application, p0rn0graphy site and crack version of software then your wallet security can be compromise.</p>

  <p>If you portfolio is less than 1000$ and you don’t want to stay in crypto for long use software wallet
  and if your portfolio is greater than 1000$ and you are like long term holder  then better to buy hardware wallet.

   <p> <strong>Gas fee: </strong> when you do any kind of activity with your wallet and to store that proof of activity in blockchain you need to pay gas fee. if you send crypto to someone then sender will pay gas fee and then only that trx will be sucessful. Gas fee for L1 is in their native coin and gas fee for L2 is generally ETH. for example if you want send 100$ via BNB chain then you need BNB coin (0.03$ to 0.5$) to execute that activity via bnb blockchain. Yes depends on blokchain gas fee amount is different. </p>
