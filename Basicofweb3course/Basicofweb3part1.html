    <p></p>In simple web3 means technological advancement in the field of internet and computer technology.
    Its a term that used to describe the new phase of internet. you may think if there is web3 then there 
    should be web1 and web 2. you guess it right there is web1, web2, web3 and by time web4 will also develope. </p>
    
    To understand Web3, first understand Web1 and Web2

    <H1 id="web1"> Web 1 Era </H1>
   <div class="paraone">
   <p id="paraonep1"> In the Web1 era, computers and other technologies were large, expensive, and difficult to use. This 
   was the time before 1990 when terms like “personal computer (PC)” and “internet” were not common. 
   If we look back the website at time, it was just a basic read only content.Websites were static, 
   and communication happened outside the web through emails or offline methods. 
   This era focused more on information sharing rather than participation.
   It was just one way communication in internet. Java script was created in 1995 AD so you can imagine 
   how the website were before 1990. Even WWW was introduce in 1989 AD. </p>

  <div class="paratwo">
   After 1990, various technologies were invented, leading to a boom in IT companies. The development 
   of PCs and the availability of the internet in different places grew.  It was easier to raised capital from 
   investor for startup who were using internet technology. We were entering in new world “the internet” 
   or Web 2 era.

    <H1 id="web2"> Web 2 Era </H1>
  <div class="paraone">
   <p>As technology evolved, we entered in the Web2 era, where we started using mobile phones, social media 
  apps, and search engines like Google. However, the main problem with Web2 technology is that the 
  owners of these companies have access to our data. They can do anything with it and they are doing so. 
  Most Web2 platforms appear free to use, but in reality users pay with their personal data. 
  Every click, like, search, and interaction is tracked and analyzed.
  This data is then used to influence user behavior and sell targeted advertisements. 
  In this model, the user is not the customer but the product. 
  This is how mostly social media platforms generate revenue. This is where the concept of Web3 
  comes in, Web3 = decentralization. </p>

  The biggest issue with Web2 is centralization. A small number of companies control massive amounts of data, users, 
  and digital infrastructure. This leads to problems like censorship, data leaks, lack of transparency, 
  and monopoly power, which slowly reduces user freedom on the internet.
  </div>

  <div class="paratwo">
  The progress and ongoing development of Web3 did not originally emerge to solve the problems of 
  Web2. The issues of Web2 and the solutions offered by Web3 were not linked before 2015, yes the web 
  3 tech exist since 1990 but it get bost after invention of blockchain. The factor that significantly 
  influenced the development of Web3 was the global economic crisis of 2008. During this time, inflation 
  was at its peak, the value of money decreased year by year, and everyone began to recognize the major 
  flaws in our fiat money financial system, where governments can print as much money as they want, 
  and banks can lend as much as they want.  
  </div>
  <div class="parathree">
  To address these issues and to stabilize the economy an anonymous person named Satoshi Nakamoto launched "bitcoin" a decentralized currency on blockchain where the amount of money is fix so 
  that no one can print new supply.
  </div>

<div class="section"> 


    <H1 id="web3"> Web 3 Era </H1>

  <div class="paraone">
  Bitcoin was created as a currency with a limited supply of 21 million and feature likes no one alter or change it. The 
  logic was  code with scripting language (bitcoin script) on the blockchain. The blockchain is used to 
  store all transactions and verify them. This lead to the development of a new term: DeFi, (decentralized 
  finance). 
  </div>
  <div class="paratwo">
  Then, in 2015, Vitalik Buterin developed another blockchain technology called Ethereum and idea of 
  smart contract were developing at that time. His idea was: Why only store data related to monetary 
  transactions on the blockchain? Why not store all kinds of data, such as bills, contracts, and more? The 
  Ethereum blockchain acts as a platform where various decentralized apps (dApps), decentralized 
  games, and other applications are developed.
  </div>
  <div class="parathree">
  The concept of blockchain web 3 tech hype up after the economic crisis and then later this technology was 
  used to develop other things in a decentralized manner. NFT, Metaverse, and crypto are still considered 
  scams by some group of people and country because they don’t see this as an immediate need in our time, 
  but perhaps their importance exist and many people are working hard on this to make internet decentralized.
