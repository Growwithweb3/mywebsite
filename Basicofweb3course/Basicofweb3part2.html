 <h1 id="block-chain"> Block-chain </h1>
 <div class="paraonep2">
 <p>The core foundation of web: 3 is block-chain, which is also called decentrilized or peer to peer 
 network. Depends on function different block-chain have different working mechanism. The main 
 function of block-chain is storing data and information with feature like transparency, encryption and immutability. 
 The block-chain is develop by scripting language and operate by node runner. </p>

 <p> You want to imagine what blockchain looks like ? </p>
 <p> Think like different computer are connect with each other. each computer is node which keeps the copy of every activity in network.
    if someone try to change anythig in network then every computer will check that acivity is legit or not.
 </p>

 <p> We will learn more about blockchain in advance series, for now think it like a decentrilized database.
 Also i would recommned you to read this <a href="https://noobprogrammerseries.hashnode.dev/how-internet-work" target="_blank"> LINK </a> article on "how internet work". To get deeper understanding on blockchain
 you need to know how internet work. </p>

<h1 id="crypto-currencies">  What are crypto currencies? </h1>
<div class="paraonep2">
Crypto currencies are digital number backed by smart contract on block-chain. The first crypto 
currency was bitcoin created in 2009 A.D by anonymous person or organization called satoshi 
nakamoto. Bitcoin was created on top of bitcoin block chain.

<h1 id="NFTs">What are NFTs? </h1>
<div class="paraonep2">
<p> NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are the proof of ownership build on block-chain. Anything in text, 
picture or video format deploy on block-chain are called NFTs. 
There is one more things similar to NFTs called as SBT (soul bounded token) which means a token 
which cannot be trade or transfer from owner account to other user account. </p> 

<p> Both are deployed on block-chain and both have their own smart contract rules which make them 
different from each other.</p>

<div class="section"> 
<h1 id="Smart-contracts"> Smart contracts </h1>
<div class="paraonep2">
<p>Smart contracts are self-executing programs which is develop by block-chain language like solidity, 
rust, move and so on. Point to be noted bitcoin is not build by smart contract but by C++ and run by 
bitcoin script. Only the modern block-chain like eth, sol, sui are smart contract platform and can run 
smart contract. </p>

<p> Smart contracts remove the need for intermediaries by automatically executing rules written in code.
 Once deployed, a smart contract cannot be changed easily, which means developers must be careful while writing them.</p>

<h1 id="node-runner"> Node runner </h1>
<div class="paraonep2">
Node runner are the backbone of block-chain that are responsible for maintaining, updating and 
backup the information on block-chain. Node runner include light node runner, full node runner, 
miners and so on. Node runner earn crypto which is one of the earning scope of web 3.
