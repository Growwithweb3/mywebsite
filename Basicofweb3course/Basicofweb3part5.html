    <h1 id="typep5"> Type of web 3 project </h1>
    <div class="paraone">
    <p>There are mainly two type of web 3 project: 
       <ul class="step" style="margin-bottom:30px;">
        <li> Infrastructure based project</li>
        <li> Poduct based project </li>
       </ul> </p>
    A solo project which provide infrastructure for other project or a project having its own blockchain are infrastructure based project. If you want to make a decenetilized social media app you don’t need to lauch your own blockchain instead you can deploy your product on other blockchain and that other blockchain is called infrastructuire based project. Think like either you make a app and upload video in it or you can upload video in youtube. Both have its own pros and cons like in youtube you need to follow their guideline but you don’t need to seek for users or invest money to build app. Same like this either build your own infrastructure or user other infrastructure.
    </div>
    <div class="paratwo">
    <p> There are different infrastructure sub categogy based on the service they provide like Layer 1 blockchain, L2 blockchain, layerzero. We will discuss these sub category in advance course for now just understand these thing. Different blockchain are build by different programming language and script. The general blockchain infrastructure where other project can build their dapps is called L1 blokchain. The blockchain which is build on top of L1 is called layer 2 blockchain and the communication medium between different blockchain is called layer0 infrastructure. </p> </div>

   <h1 id="pds"> project development stage </h1>
   <div class="paraone">
    <p> Either you want to lauch your own project or you are seeking oppourtunities in project you need to know how web 3 project established so that you can position yourself accrodingly.</p>
    <p>
    Suppose you want to earn airdrop by contributing in project, in this case you need know in which stage the project is. Suppose you start contributing but after a week project announced TGE. In this case there is very low chance that you will get any airdrops. The more earlier you are the more easier to postion for reward. 
    </p>
   </div>

   <div class="paratwo">
   <h2> Phase 1: Pre build stage</h2>
   <p>In this stage no one know about project, its goal and use case. Team start working on project idea, white paper and way to raise fund for building. If you are founder then only you need to go through this stage and  for contributor like us, its non of our business.</p>

   <h2> Phase 2: Seed round</h2>
   <p> In this stage project raise some investment for working. This is called seed round and there is high possibility of project to raise more fund. You will find many project that are in seed round where you can apply for jobs and intenship. As they did not have big capital to hire professional so chances of getting job and intenship is preety high and also don’t expect any kind of airdrop in next 6 month because it will take time to reach in that stage.</p>

   <h2> Phase 3: Testnet deployment</h2>
   <p> After seed round project deploy testnet. There are lot of benefit of launching testnet like user can test their product and give feedback for necessary improvement. Testnet will also create a hype in market. To understand about testnet simply think it’s a real product of web3 with fake money called faucet.</p> <p>
   One more benefit of testnet is that if testnet suceess with millions of user inetraction then project can raise new invetsment from investor which is called phase 4.
   </p>

   <h2> Phase 4: Series of funding</h2>
   <p> After seed round project can go for new funding round before mainnet. Series A, series B and so on like this project raise new investment which will evenutully grow project and chance of bettter reward is there. Some project switched off after not getting new invetsment and some project scam the investor by raiseing fund but not using for product development.</p>

   <h2> Phase 5: Legal compliance and smart contract auditing</h2>
   <p> This is one the most important stage where project need to complete legal compliace based on their location. If project conduct presale then they need to dicsolse the investment amount and detail of user who are investing under AMT and CFT act ( Anti money laundaring and combat finance for terrorism). 
   Another important work that need to be done is smart contract auditing. No its no that like account an finance department related stuff. Smart contract auditing means finding out vulnarilibilty and bugs in smaart contract to project the user data and fund. If you depsoit some fund in project with no smart contract auditing then your fund may stolen by hacker and no one can do anything. There must be reputated thrid party for smart contract auditing.
   </p>

   <h2> Phase 5: Partnership, snapshot and liquidity management</h2>
   <p> This is called pre tge stage where project announce its offical ecosystem partner, prepare liquidity to add in ecosystem and snapshot to reward user.</p>
   <p id="snapshot"><strong> Snapshot </strong> means saving on chain data and of chain participant in project camping who can be eligible for reward. After snap shot criteria will determine with ncessary sybil implecation. People who meet mininim criteria before snapshot date will get reward.</p>
   <p id="sybil"> <strong> Sybil </strong>hunting means finding and removing participant who did cheating or break the rule of airdrop camping. Like making thousands of account and take part in camping which will dilute the reward per user.</p>

   <h2> Phase 6: Mainnet, TGE and listing </h2>
   <p id="mainnet"> <strong> Main-net</strong> is same like testnet but with real money. If its L1 project then blockchain will live with its ecosystem, if its finance based product then it will deploy in mainnet blockchain.</p>
   <p id="TGE"><strong>TGE</strong> token generating event where project launch its token and may be reward airdrops to contributors.For L1 project mainnet and Tge will happen in same day and time but for L2 and service based project TGE will happen  generally after 6-12 month of mainnet. </p>
   <p id="vesting"> <strong> Vesting </strong> lockup period of token for team, investors and community. Suppose a coin with 1 billion total supply list in market but question is what initial supply is because as we know lower the supply higher the price and to save community from VCs dump vesting mechanism exist in market.</p>
   <p> Crypto get listed in DEX, CEX from where user can buy sell them. The better the listing- better the price.</p>

   <h2>Phase 8: Post mainnet  </h2>
   <p>After mainnet, Tge and listing all it left to do in new update and new incentive camping. If project is fundamentally strong your job is oky but 90% project will eridacate from maerket, deslit from CEX. </p>
